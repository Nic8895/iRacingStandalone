iRacingStandalone
=================

A modified version of Firefox Portable for playing iRacing.

I wanted a small client, that I could use instead of very memory hungry normal browser. Since this is a dedicated client it also provides something to associate with Steam,

Here are the following modifications made:
- Branding/Icons of Firefox have been changed to look like the iRacing logo
- Browser UI has been stripped down. No nav bar, tabbar only appears when multiple tabs are opened.
- Greasemonkey is installed and the following site enhancing scripts are loaded:
	- iRacing Auto Join - This adds a checkbox after registering for a session. Once the timer ends and the green Join, Watch or Spot button comes available it's automatically clicked
	- iRacing Better Lapchards - This script adds better interactive lapcharts to race result pages
	- iRacing Online Friends - Highlight your Friends and Watched Drivers on the Dashboard and Series Session pages, so you know where they are driving.
	- iRacing Road Only - Hides content unrelated to road racing
- Options, addons, and greasemonkey configuration have been put into the right click context menu
